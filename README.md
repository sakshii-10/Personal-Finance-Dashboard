## 🛠 Data Preparation Steps

The Excel file was cleaned and transformed before and/or inside Power BI:

1. **Fixed Month–Year Headers**
   - Converted headers like `Jan-18`, `Feb-18`… from text into real date values.
   - Ensured years (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.) are correctly recognized in Power BI.

2. **Unpivoted Data**
   - Original sheet was in a wide format (one column per month).
   - Using **Power Query**, the data was unpivoted into a long format with:
     - `Type`
     - `Component`
     - `Date`
     - `Value` (amount)

3. **Data Types & Formatting**
   - Set proper data types: `Date` for dates, `Text` for categories, `Decimal/Whole Number` for values.
   - Checked for missing / inconsistent values and corrected them where required.
